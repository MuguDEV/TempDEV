# TempDEV

A Small Project made by me. For Conversion of Temperature from one [Temperature Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_of_temperature) to Another

## USAGE

```Python
#Create an Object
temp = Celsius()
print(temp.convert(1))
```

## Output

On Executing the above code it gives output as [Dictionary](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-dictionary/). like this

```Python
{'Fahrenheit': 33.8, 'Kelvin': 274.15}
```

> Available Temperature Scales
 - Celsius
 - Fahrenheit
 - Kelvin

> Update
  
  `Many Scales will added to this Project! Soon....`
